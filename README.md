# ER-Model-Creator

This is a Java SWT Project designed to make the creation of ER-Models easier.

# Running the project

SWT package (found at the [SWT download page](https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/R-4.26-202211231800/), look for the `SWT Binary and Source` package) is required.

The Font `Liberation Mono` is also required.

Then just run the `ModelDrawer` class.
